            <h2>Atmospheric carbon reduction: exploring solutions through science and societal innovative approaches - an NSF-funded Convergence Accelerator Workshop - Join us to Jumpstart the Discussion</h2>
            <h3>A Workshop to identify opportunities to expand capacity from an engineering and geoscience perspective</h3>

            <h4>Join us for 3-days to develop novel cross-disciplinary collaborations!</h4>
            <p><strong>Applications are due September 21st, 2020 (5pm Eastern Time). Apply Today!</strong></p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Ongoing science and technology efforts aim to achieve the needed reduction of atmospheric carbon by injection into site-specific reservoirs, with clear metrics for storage and leakage. These experiments have been accompanied by abundant modeling and analysis of the geologic reservoir system from the pore scale to the field scale, and attention to concerns surrounding induced seismicity. Meanwhile, geographic, social science, and economic analyses have progressed to the point where models can predict the cost returns under 45Q, and debate the relative merits of any geoengineering solution to the climate crisis. This workshop aims to bridge these highly disparate communities in a discussion that we hope will frame a real-world paradigm shift where carbon can be actively reduced in a way that blends science and technology with broader national and global views of the atmospheric carbon dilemma. Through the technologies that enhance the reduction of atmospheric CO2, new economic opportunities and new jobs would be realized to support this shift. This interactive workshop provides a rare opportunity for the scientists, industry, government, and the general public to chart out this future. </p>
            <h3>Date and Location</h3>
            <p><strong>The event will be held online from 12:00- 3:00 PM EST, and will take place on September 28th, October 1st and October 6th</strong></p>
            <h3>Commitment</h3>
            <p>Applicants must commit to participating for the entire duration of the meeting (three 3-hour workshops, spanning 1 week) if selected as a meeting participant.</p>
            <p>There will also be some required prework and light background reading/viewing.</p>
            <h3>Motivation: The industry challenge and academic technology transfer</h3>
            <p>What are feasible carbon capture approaches? What are the technological challenges of each of them? What are the ways to employ geological and geophysical knowledge and expertise? How can we use CCS expertise from large site-specific experiments in other approaches? What are the unintended consequences in terms of earthquakes, groundwater response, and leakage?</p>
            
            <h3>Motivation: What are the community needs, perceptions, and involvement?</h3>
            <p>How can a wider group of citizens become partners in the effort of carbon capture? How can we gauge public perception? What are strategies and tools that people want?</p>
            
            <h3>Motivation: Building collaborations that eliminate workforce/disciplinary silos</h3>
            <p>What types of businesses and policy-makers can be entrained in this effort? How can we best use the existing energy infrastructure and legacy data on carbon reduction efforts? What is the key to a responsible public-private partnership?</p>
            
            <h3>The Specific Challenges</h3>
            <p>During the Jumpstart, we will be splitting into breakout groups consisting of experts from various disparate fields and the workshop organizers will be responsive to all discussions in the breakout virtual rooms. While the scope is expansive, we expect that the rooms might cover topics such as:
            <p><strong>Capturing carbon in a world with infrastructure as it exists now</strong></p>     
            <ul>
              <li>Post-combustion - What are proven technologies for post-combustion carbon capture at industrial point-sources? Are conventional chemical scrubbers the most effective technologies?</li>
              <li>Pre-combustion - Can carbon be removed or reduced prior to combustion in an economical way? How does coal gasification become economically feasible in a world of cheap natural gas? Can combustion be controlled so that it is more cost-effective to remove carbon from flue gases?</li>
              <li>Removing carbon from the atmosphere - Backyard/citizen science</li>
              <li>Replacing the fuels we use today - Can biofuels (including use of net carbon-negative fuels generated from plants bioengineered to take up carbon) be realized on a large-scale?</li>
            </ul>
              
            <h3>Who Should Apply</h3>
            <p>We encourage a wide representation of participation spanning research, government, industry and public policy sectors. All levels of seniority with diverse expertise across the continuum of carbon capture research and complementary fields including, but not limited to: geophyscis, seismology, geology, reservoir engineering, chemical engineering, sociology, political theory, biofuels, plant bioengineering, data science, mathematics, and backyard citizen scientists to consider how your experience could help shape and transform the future of carbon sustainability research technologies.</p>
            <p>Irrespective of expertise, we are most interested in new, innovative ideas and original thinking that arise from new collaborations between people of diverse backgrounds and varying expertise.</p>
            <p>Approximately 100 applicants will be selected to participate in the Jumpstart on the basis of the interests, expertise, and other characteristics solicited in the application. Most participants are expected to be academic faculty, from early career to senior investigators. Original thinkers from outside academia (e.g., industry, public sector) or earlier career stages are also encouraged to apply. When selecting participants, consideration will be given to balance across a range of diverse disciplinary experience and expertise. All participants should be willing to engage in frank disclosure and assessment of ideas in a collegial and professional fashion. To facilitate open sharing, all meeting discussions will be considered a private communication and not to be shared outside of the meeting, unless approved by the contributor. All research-related application information will be kept confidential.</p>
